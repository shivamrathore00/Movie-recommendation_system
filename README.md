# Movie Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis and Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive movie recommendation system that integrates sentiment analysis, user clustering, and reinforcement learning to provide personalized movie recommendations.

### Features
- Sentiment Analysis of movie reviews using supervised learning.
- User clustering based on viewing patterns using unsupervised learning.
- Personalized movie recommendations using reinforcement learning.

### Project Structure
- `sentiment_analysis.py`: Contains code for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.
- `user_clustering.py`: Contains code for clustering users based on their movie ratings.
- `reinforcement_learning.py`: Contains code for implementing and training the reinforcement learning agent.
